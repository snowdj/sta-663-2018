    "When $m>n$, the system may be *overdetermined*.  In other words, there are more equations than unknowns.  They system could be inconsistent, or some of the equations could be redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many techniques to solve and analyze linear systems.  Our goal is to understand the theory behind many of the built-in functions, and how they *efficiently* solve systems of equations."

    "\n",
    "Square matrices have the same number of columns (usually denoted $n$).  We refer to an arbitrary square matrix as and $n\\times n$ or we refer to it as a 'square matrix of dimension $n$'.  If an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ has *full rank* (i.e. it has rank $n$), then $A$ is invertible, and its inverse is unique.  This is a situation that leads to a unique solution to a linear system.\n",

    "A diagonal matrix is a matrix with all entries off the diagonal equal to zero.  Strictly speaking, such a matrix should be square, but we can also consider rectangular matrices of size $m\\times n$ to be diagonal, if all entries $a_{ij}$ are zero for $i\\neq j$\n",
